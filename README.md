[Cryptic](https://cryptic-gamma.vercel.app/) is a note taking app with emphasis on privacy.

Less is more. Cryptic trades some convenience in favor of privacy which means:
 - You are not required to create account.
 - App doesn't know anything about you.
 - Create private password locked notes.
 - Import notes, export notes, send notes to others however you like.

### Future features under consideration
 - [x] - Persist to local storage. (Don't forget to export your notes when you reinstall your browser)
 - [x] - Auto lock private notes when exporting and storing in local storage.
 - [ ] - Selecting multiple notes for export.
 - [ ] - Markdown or rich text editor support.
 - [ ] - PWA maybe.
 - [ ] - Mobile support.

### FYI
**Be mindful when storing any sensitive information in your notes**. This is just a pet project and my attempt at learning and understanding cryptography, in fact feel free to point out any issues or vulnerabilities, i'm always happy to learn.

### Developing
Clone repo, install dependencies, run - `npm run dev`
